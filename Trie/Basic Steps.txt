INSERTION
1. Traverse the trie according to the key used
2. If we encounter a null ref on the letter, then create new one
3. On the last letter, insert the necessary value in the node

SEARCHING
1. traverse the trie
2. Get the value in the last letter node


DELETING
1. Traverse the trie until the last letter
2. Check if the references are null, if yes delete the node ( repeat until the references is not null).
	if no, it's done
